# Image-Captioning
With the help of DeepLearning we can solve the problem of generating a caption for a given image

The dataset used for this task is Flickr30000 used from Kaggle. This contains nearly 30,000 images and their corresponding captions of appx 150000, (each image has 5 captions associated). I have considered 95% as train data and 5% as test data.
